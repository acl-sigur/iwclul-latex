# iwclul-latex

IWCLUL uses ACL style files for all workshops to appear in ACL anthology.

## ACL style

ACL SIGUR uses the most recent ACL style files (e.g. [Google ACL
cfp](https://www.google.com/search?q=acl+cfp) or such), with following optional
improvements:

* You can (should) use `xelatex` and Unicode instead of some more ancient TeX
  version and typesetting extended Latin, Cyrillic, IPA and UPA more easily.
* You can use biblatex instead of bibtex

If you do other changes to packages or style files, please ensure that the
result looks reasonably much like the ACL reference file and that the anonymised
versions are anonymised and the camera-ready versions are not.

If you can not use latex please search for further informations / office
templates on ACL web pages.
