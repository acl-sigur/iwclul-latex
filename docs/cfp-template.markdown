## Call for papers

The purpose of the conference series International Workshop on Computational
Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers working on
computational approaches to working with these languages. We accept long and
short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages:
Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak),
Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest),
Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian,
Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.

All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes
processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic
approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are
endangered.

Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that
can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation
schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal
of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and
research groups Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):

* Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages
* Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries
* Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as spelling or
  grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing
* Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks
* Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to Uralic
  languages
* Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational linguistics
  for one or more Uralic languages
* Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of work
* How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns, games
  with a purpose

To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we
particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language
resources and make use of free/open-source software.  One of the aims of this
gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in field of Uralistics by
establishing connections and interoperability standards between researchers and
research groups working at different sites. We have also identified a serious
lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all Uralic languages including
those with national support, any work towards better resources in these fields
will be greatly appreciated.

## Important dates

* July @YEAR-1@: Call for papers announced
* October @YEAR-1@: 2nd call for papers
* November @YEAR-1@: Paper submission deadline
* December @YEAR-1@: Paper notification
* December @YEAR-1@: Camera-ready deadline

## Submission of papers

Language of submission: Submissions should be made in English or Russian with an
obligatory abstract in at least one of the Uralic Language(s).

Submission format:
* Papers should be up to 18 pages in length excluding references.
* Submissions should be formatted using [our latex style
  template](https://github.com/acl-sigur/iwclul-latex).
* Citations should be managed with bibtex.
* Linguistic glosses should follow Leipzig glossing rules and use expex
  LaTeX package (make sure to update expex regularly as it is developed
  actively).
* Preferred LaTeX version is XeLaTeX and therefore you should use UTF-8 encoded
  Unicode in your sources rather than TeX encoded characters where possible.
* For any further details, please read the template and its source code.

Download template here:

*If you do not have access to LaTeX text processing system, please contact us for
alternative templates and instructions.*

Submissions can be made here using the EasyChair conference management system:

Publication venue: Proceedings of the workshop will be published open-access in
ACL anthology, SIG proceedings for SIGUR.

Conflicts of interest: The reviewing process will be anonymous (double-blind
peer review).

Double submission: To maximise the impact of work in the field of computational
linguistics for the Uralic languages we are open to the possibility of double
submission, or submission of work which has been partially published elsewhere.
Any double submission should however be reported to the programme committee at
the time of submission. In the advent of double acceptance the authors should
choose in which venue to publish.
